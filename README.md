The Personalized Medical Recommendation System is a Python-based application that aims to assist users in diagnosing potential diseases based on their symptoms. By leveraging machine learning, the system analyzes the input symptoms, matches them to a disease, and provides tailored medical advice, including recommended treatments, medications, diets, and lifestyle changes. This system not only serves as a diagnostic tool but also offers personalized health guidance, making it useful for individuals who want to understand their symptoms more clearly or need quick guidance before seeking professional medical help. Its objective is to bridge the gap between basic symptom observation and expert medical advice, making healthcare more accessible, especially in areas with limited medical resources.
